ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non- governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.

The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further maintenance are described in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. In particular the different approval criteria needed for the different types of ISO documents should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the editorial rules of the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2 (see www.iso.org/directives).

This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition (ISO 9001:2008), which has been technically revised, through the adoption of a revised clause sequence and the adaptation of the revised quality management principles and of new concepts.

# Introduction

# 0.1 General

The adoption of a quality management system is a strategic decision for an organization that can help to improve its overall performance and provide a sound basis for sustainable development initiatives.

The potential benefits to an organization of implementing a quality management system based on this International Standard are:

a) the ability to consistently provide products and services that meet customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements; 
b) facilitating opportunities to enhance customer satisfaction; 
c) addressing risks and opportunities associated with its context and objectives; 
d) the ability to demonstrate conformity to specified quality management system requirements.

This International Standard can be used by internal and external parties.

It is not the intent of this International Standard to imply the need for:

uniformity in the structure of different quality management systems; alignment of documentation to the clause structure of this International Standard; the use of the specific terminology of this International Standard within the organization.

The quality management system requirements specified in this International Standard are complementary to requirements for products and services.

This International Standard employs the process approach, which incorporates the Plan- Do- Check- Act (PDCA) cycle and risk- based thinking.

The process approach enables an organization to plan its processes and their interactions.

The PDCA cycle enables an organization to ensure that its processes are adequately resourced and managed, and that opportunities for improvement are determined and acted on.

Risk- based thinking enables an organization to determine the factors that could cause its processes and its quality management system to deviate from the planned results, to put in place preventive controls to minimize negative effects and to make maximum use of opportunities as they arise (see Clause A.4).

Consistently meeting requirements and addressing future needs and expectations poses a challenge for organizations in an increasingly dynamic and complex environment. To achieve this objective, the organization might find it necessary to adopt various forms of improvement in addition to correction and continual improvement, such as breakthrough change, innovation and re- organization.

In this International Standard, the following verbal forms are used:

"shall" indicates a requirement; "should" indicates a recommendation; "may" indicates a permission; "can" indicates a possibility or a capability.

Information marked as "NOTE" is for guidance in understanding or clarifying the associated requirement.

# 0.2 Quality management principles

This International Standard is based on the quality management principles described in ISO 9000. The descriptions include a statement of each principle, a rationale of why the principle is important for the organization, some examples of benefits associated with the principle and examples of typical actions to improve the organization's performance when applying the principle.

The quality management principles are:

customer focus; leadership; engagement of people; process approach; improvement; evidence- based decision making; relationship management.

# 0.3 Process approach

# 0.3.1 General

This International Standard promotes the adoption of a process approach when developing, implementing and improving the effectiveness of a quality management system, to enhance customer satisfaction by meeting customer requirements. Specific requirements considered essential to the adoption of a process approach are included in 4.4.

Understanding and managing interrelated processes as a system contributes to the organization's effectiveness and efficiency in achieving its intended results. This approach enables the organization to control the interrelationships and interdependencies among the processes of the system, so that the overall performance of the organization can be enhanced.

The process approach involves the systematic definition and management of processes, and their interactions, so as to achieve the intended results in accordance with the quality policy and strategic direction of the organization. Management of the processes and the system as a whole can be achieved using the PDCA cycle (see 0.3.2) with an overall focus on risk- based thinking (see 0.3.3) aimed at taking advantage of opportunities and preventing undesirable results.

The application of the process approach in a quality management system enables:

a) understanding and consistency in meeting requirements; 
b) the consideration of processes in terms of added value; 
c) the achievement of effective process performance; 
d) improvement of processes based on evaluation of data and information.

Figure 1 gives a schematic representation of any process and shows the interaction of its elements. The monitoring and measuring checkpoints, which are necessary for control, are specific to each process and will vary depending on the related risks.

Figure 1 — Schematic representation of the elements of a single process

# 0.3.2 Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle

The PDCA cycle can be applied to all processes and to the quality management system as a whole. Figure 2 illustrates how Clauses 4 to 10 can be grouped in relation to the PDCA cycle.

![](images/d83070d265b431052ff09ec8b38e348961c4117a9211b7da3a4b077e469d8f21.jpg)  
Figure 2 — Representation of the structure of this International Standard in the PDCA cycle

The PDCA cycle can be briefly described as follows:

Plan: establish the objectives of the system and its processes, and the resources needed to deliver results in accordance with customers' requirements and the organization's policies; Do: implement what was planned; Check: monitor and (where applicable) measure processes and the resulting products and services against policies, objectives and requirements and report the results; Act: take actions to improve performance, as necessary.

# 0.3.3 Risk-based thinking

Risk- based thinking (see Clause A.4) is essential for achieving an effective quality management system. The concept of risk- based thinking has been implicit in previous editions of this International Standard including, for example, carrying out preventive action to eliminate potential nonconformities, analysing any nonconformities that do occur, and taking action to prevent recurrence that is appropriate for the effects of the nonconformity.

To conform to the requirements of this International Standard, an organization needs to plan and implement actions to address risks and opportunities. Addressing both risks and opportunities establishes a basis for increasing the effectiveness of the quality management system, achieving improved results and preventing negative effects.

Opportunities can arise as a result of a situation favourable to achieving an intended result, for example, a set of circumstances that allow the organization to attract customers, develop new products and services, reduce waste or improve productivity. Actions to address opportunities can also include consideration of associated risks. Risk is the effect of uncertainty and any such uncertainty can have positive or negative effects. A positive deviation arising from a risk can provide an opportunity, but not all positive effects of risk result in opportunities.

# 0.4 Relationship with other management system standards

This International Standard applies the framework developed by ISO to improve alignment among its International Standards for management systems (see Clause A.1).

This International Standard enables an organization to use the process approach, coupled with the PDCA cycle and risk- based thinking, to align or integrate its quality management system with the requirements of other management system standards.

This International Standard relates to ISO 9000 and ISO 9004 as follows:

ISO 9000 Quality management systems - Fundamentals and vocabulary provides essential background for the proper understanding and implementation of this International Standard; ISO 9004 Managing for the sustained success of an organization - A quality management approach provides guidance for organizations that choose to progress beyond the requirements of this International Standard.

Annex B provides details of other International Standards on quality management and quality management systems that have been developed by ISO/TC 176.

This International Standard does not include requirements specific to other management systems, such as those for environmental management, occupational health and safety management, or financial management.

Sector- specific quality management system standards based on the requirements of this International Standard have been developed for a number of sectors. Some of these standards specify additional quality management system requirements, while others are limited to providing guidance to the application of this International Standard within the particular sector.

# ISO/FDIS 9001:2015(E)

# Annex A (informative)

# Clarification of new structure, terminology and concepts

# A.1 Structure and terminology

The clause structure (i.e. clause sequence) and some of the terminology of this edition of this International Standard, in comparison with the previous edition (ISO 9001:2008), have been changed to improve alignment with other management systems standards.

There is no requirement in this International Standard for its structure and terminology to be applied to the documented information of an organization's quality management system.

The structure of clauses is intended to provide a coherent presentation of requirements, rather than a model for documenting an organization's policies, objectives and processes. The structure and content of documented information related to a quality management system can often be more relevant to its users if it relates to both the processes operated by the organization and information maintained for other purposes.

There is no requirement for the terms used by an organization to be replaced by the terms used in this International Standard to specify quality management system requirements. Organizations can choose to use terms which suit their operations (e.g. using "records", "documentation" or "protocols" rather than "documented information"; or "supplier", "partner" or "vendor" rather than "external provider"). Table A.1 shows the major differences in terminology between this edition of this International Standard and the previous edition.

Table A.1 Major differences in terminology between ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 9001:2015  

<table><tr><td>ISO 9001:2008</td><td>ISO 9001:2015</td></tr><tr><td>Products</td><td>Products and services</td></tr><tr><td>Exclusions</td><td>Not used 
(See Clause A.5 for clarification of applicability)</td></tr><tr><td>Management representative</td><td>Not used 
(Similar responsibilities and authorities are assigned but no requirement for a single management repre-sentative)</td></tr><tr><td>Documentation, quality manual, documented pro-cedures, records</td><td>Documented information</td></tr><tr><td>Work environment</td><td>Environment for the operation of processes</td></tr><tr><td>Monitoring and measuring equipment</td><td>Monitoring and measuring resources</td></tr><tr><td>Purchased product</td><td>Externally provided products and services</td></tr><tr><td>Supplier</td><td>External provider</td></tr></table>

# A.2 Products and services

ISO 9001:2008 used the term "product" to include all output categories. This edition of this International Standard uses "products and services". The term "products and services" includes all output categories (hardware, services, software and processed materials).

The specific inclusion of "services" is intended to highlight the differences between products and services in the application of some requirements. The characteristic of services is that at least part of the output is realized at the interface with the customer. This means, for example, that conformity to requirements cannot necessarily be confirmed before service delivery.

In most cases, products and services are used together. Most outputs that organizations provide to customers, or are supplied to them by external providers, include both products and services. For example, a tangible or intangible product can have some associated service or a service can have some associated tangible or intangible product.

# A.3 Understanding the needs and expectations of interested parties

Subclause 4.2 specifies requirements for the organization to determine the interested parties that are relevant to the quality management system and the requirements of those interested parties. However, 4.2 does not imply extension of quality management system requirements beyond the scope of this International Standard. As stated in the scope, this International Standard is applicable where an organization needs to demonstrate its ability to consistently provide products and services that meet customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, and aims to enhance customer satisfaction.

There is no requirement in this International Standard for the organization to consider interested parties where it has decided that those parties are not relevant to its quality management system. It is for the organization to decide if a particular requirement of a relevant interested party is relevant to its quality management system.

# A.4 Risk-based thinking

The concept of risk- based thinking has been implicit in previous editions of this International Standard, e.g. through requirements for planning, review and improvement. This International Standard specifies requirements for the organization to understand its context (see 4.1) and determine risks as a basis for planning (see 6.1). This represents the application of risk- based thinking to planning and implementing quality management system processes (see 4.4) and will assist in determining the extent of documented information.

One of the key purposes of a quality management system is to act as a preventive tool. Consequently, this International Standard does not have a separate clause or subclause on preventive action. The concept of preventive action is expressed through the use of risk- based thinking in formulating quality management system requirements.

The risk- based thinking applied in this International Standard has enabled some reduction in prescriptive requirements and their replacement by performance- based requirements. There is greater flexibility than in ISO 9001:2008 in the requirements for processes, documented information and organizational responsibilities.

Although 6.1 specifies that the organization shall plan actions to address risks, there is no requirement for formal methods for risk management or a documented risk management process. Organizations can decide whether or not to develop a more extensive risk management methodology than is required by this International Standard, e.g. through the application of other guidance or standards.

Not all the processes of a quality management system represent the same level of risk in terms of the organizations ability to meet its objectives, and the effects of uncertainty are not the same for all organizations. Under the requirements of 6.1, the organization is responsible for its application of risk- based thinking and the actions it takes to address risk, including whether or not to retain documented information as evidence of its determination of risks.

# A.5 Applicability

This International Standard does not refer to "exclusions" in relation to the applicability of its requirements to the organization's quality management system. However, an organization can review the applicability of requirements due to the size or complexity of the organization, the management model it adopts, the range of the organization's activities and the nature of the risks and opportunities it encounters.

The requirements for applicability are addressed in 4.3, which defines conditions under which an organization can decide that a requirement cannot be applied to any of the processes within the scope of its quality management system. The organization can only decide that a requirement is not applicable if its decision will not result in failure to achieve conformity of products and services.

# A.6 Documented information

As part of the alignment with other management system standards, a common clause on "documented information" has been adopted without significant change or addition (see 7.5). Where appropriate, text elsewhere in this International Standard has been aligned with its requirements. Consequently, "documented information" is used for all document requirements.

Where ISO 9001:2008 used specific terminology such as "document" or "documented procedures", "quality manual" or "quality plan", this edition of this International Standard defines requirements to "maintain documented information".

Where ISO 9001:2008 used the term "records" to denote documents needed to provide evidence of conformity with requirements, this is now expressed as a requirement to "retain documented information". The organization is responsible for determining what documented information needs to be retained, the period of time for which it is to be retained and the media to be used for its retention.

A requirement to "maintain" documented information does not exclude the possibility that the organization might also need to "retain" that same documented information for a particular purpose, e.g. to retain previous versions of it.

Where this International Standard refers to "information" rather than "documented information" (e.g. in 4.1: "The organization shall monitor and review the information about these external and internal issues"), there is no requirement that this information is to be documented. In such situations, the organization can decide whether or not it is necessary or appropriate to maintain documented information.

# A.7 Organizational knowledge

In 7.1.6, this International Standard addresses the need to determine and manage the knowledge maintained by the organization, to ensure that it can achieve conformity of products and services.

Requirements regarding organizational knowledge were introduced for the purpose of:

a) safeguarding the organization from loss of knowledge, e.g.

through staff turnover;

failure to capture and share information;

b) encouraging the organization to acquire knowledge, e.g.

learning from experience;

mentoring;

benchmarking.

# A.8 Control of externally provided processes, products and services

All forms of externally provided processes, products and services are addressed in 8.4, e.g. whether through:

a) purchasing from a supplier;  
b) an arrangement with an associate company;  
c) outsourcing processes to an external provider.

Outsourcing always has the essential characteristic of a service, since it will have at least one activity necessarily performed at the interface between the provider and the organization.

The controls required for external provision can vary widely depending on the nature of the processes, products and services. The organization can apply risk- based thinking to determine the type and extent of controls appropriate to particular external providers and externally provided processes, products and services.

# Annex B (informative)

# Other International Standards on quality management and quality management systems developed by ISO/TC 176

The International Standards described in this annex have been developed by ISO/TC 176 to provide supporting information for organizations that apply this International Standard, and to provide guidance for organizations that choose to progress beyond its requirements. Guidance or requirements contained in the documents listed in this annex do not add to, or modify, the requirements of this International Standard.

Table B.1 shows the relationship between these standards and the relevant clauses of this International Standard.

This annex does not include reference to the sector- specific quality management system standards developed by ISO/TC 176.

This International Standard is one of the three core standards developed by ISO/TC 176.

ISO 9000 Quality management systems - Fundamentals and vocabulary provides an essential background for the proper understanding and implementation of this International Standard. The quality management principles are described in detail in ISO 9000 and have been taken into consideration during the development of this International Standard. These principles are not requirements in themselves, but they form the foundation of the requirements specified by this International Standard. ISO 9000 also defines the terms, definitions and concepts used in this International Standard.

ISO 9001 (this International Standard) specifies requirements aimed primarily at giving confidence in the products and services provided by an organization and thereby enhancing customer satisfaction. Its proper implementation can also be expected to bring other organizational benefits, such as improved internal communication, better understanding and control of the organization's processes.

ISO 9004 Managing for the sustained success of an organization - A quality management approach provides guidance for organizations that choose to progress beyond the requirements of this International Standard, to address a broader range of topics that can lead to improvement of the organization's overall performance. ISO 9004 includes guidance on a self- assessment methodology for an organization to be able to evaluate the level of maturity of its quality management system.

The International Standards outlined below can provide assistance to organizations when they are establishing or seeking to improve their quality management systems, their processes or their activities.

ISO 10001 Quality management - Customer satisfaction - Guidelines for codes of conduct for organizations provides guidance to an organization in determining that its customer satisfaction provisions meet customer needs and expectations. Its use can enhance customer confidence in an organization and improve customer understanding of what to expect from an organization, thereby reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings and complaints.

ISO 10002 Quality management - Customer satisfaction - Guidelines for complaints handling in organizations provides guidance on the process of handling complaints by recognizing and addressing the needs and expectations of complainants and resolving any complaints received. ISO 10002 provides an open, effective and easy- to- use complaints process, including training of people. It also provides guidance for small businesses.

ISO 10003 Quality management - Customer satisfaction - Guidelines for dispute resolution external to organizations provides guidance for effective and efficient external dispute resolution for product- related complaints. Dispute resolution gives an avenue of redress when organizations

do not remedy a complaint internally. Most complaints can be resolved successfully within the organization, without adversarial procedures.

ISO 10004 Quality management - Customer satisfaction - Guidelines for monitoring and measuring provides guidelines for actions to enhance customer satisfaction and to determine opportunities for improvement of products, processes and attributes that are valued by customers. Such actions can strengthen customer loyalty and help retain customers.

ISO 10005 Quality management systems - Guidelines for quality plans provides guidance on establishing and using quality plans as a means of relating requirements of the process, product, project or contract, to work methods and practices that support product realization. Benefits of establishing a quality plan are increased confidence that requirements will be met, that processes are in control and the motivation that this can give to those involved.

ISO 10006 Quality management systems - Guidelines for quality management in projects is applicable to projects from the small to large, from simple to complex, from an individual project to being part of a portfolio of projects. ISO 10006 is to be used by personnel managing projects and who need to ensure that their organization is applying the practices contained in the ISO quality management system standards.

ISO 10007 Quality management systems - Guidelines for configuration management is to assist organizations applying configuration management for the technical and administrative direction over the life cycle of a product. Configuration management can be used to meet the product identification and traceability requirements specified in this International Standard.

ISO 10008 Quality management - Customer satisfaction - Guidelines for business- to- consumer electronic commerce transactions gives guidance on how organizations can implement an effective and efficient business- to- consumer electronic commerce transaction (B2C ECT) system, and thereby provide a basis for consumers to have increased confidence in B2C ECTs, enhance the ability of organizations to satisfy consumers and help reduce complaints and disputes.

ISO 10012 Measurement management systems - Requirements for measurement processes and measuring equipment provides guidance for the management of measurement processes and metrological confirmation of measuring equipment used to support and demonstrate compliance with metrological requirements. ISO 10012 provides quality management criteria for a measurement management system to ensure metrological requirements are met.

ISO/TR 10013 Guidelines for quality management system documentation provides guidelines for the development and maintenance of the documentation necessary for a quality management system. ISO/TR 10013 can be used to document management systems other than those of the ISO quality management system standards, e.g. environmental management systems and safety management systems.

ISO 10014 Quality management - Guidelines for realizing financial and economic benefits is addressed to top management. It provides guidelines for realizing financial and economic benefits through the application of quality management principles. It facilitates application of management principles and selection of methods and tools that enable the sustainable success of an organization.

ISO 10015 Quality management - Guidelines for training provides guidelines to assist organizations in addressing issues related to training. ISO 10015 can be applied whenever guidance is required to interpret references to "education" and "training" within the ISO quality management system standards. Any reference to "training" includes all types of education and training.

ISO/TR 10017 Guidance on statistical techniques for ISO 9001:2000 explains statistical techniques which follow from the variability that can be observed in the behaviour and results of processes, even under conditions of apparent stability. Statistical techniques allow better use of available data to assist in decision making, and thereby help to continually improve the quality of products and processes to achieve customer satisfaction.
